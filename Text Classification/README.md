# Text Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building supervised machine learning models
for text classification using classical NLP techniques.


## Objective

- Preprocess raw text data
- Convert text into numerical features
- Train and evaluate classification models

## Methodology

### Text Preprocessing
- Tokenisation
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization

### Feature Engineering
- Bag-of-Words
- TF-IDF

### Models Used
- Naïve Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## How to Run

1. Open `Task_1.ipynb`
2. Ensure dataset is located in the `dataset/` folder
3. Run notebook cells sequentially
