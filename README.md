# Natural Language Processing Projects

This repository contains multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects
developed as part of postgraduate-level coursework and independent practice.

The projects demonstrate end-to-end NLP pipelines including text preprocessing,
feature engineering, supervised text classification, and unsupervised topic modelling.

## Projects Overview

### Text Classification
- Built classical machine learning models for text classification
- Applied NLP preprocessing and vectorisation techniques
- Evaluated models using standard classification metrics

### Topic Modelling from Unstructured Text
- Analysed real-world unstructured news data
- Implemented LDA and NMF topic modelling techniques
- Visualised and interpreted discovered themes

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Text preprocessing (tokenisation, lemmatisation, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF)
- Supervised learning for NLP
- Unsupervised topic modelling (LDA, NMF)
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Data visualisation for NLP insights
